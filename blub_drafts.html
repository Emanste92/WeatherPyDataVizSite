<p>"<em>What's the weather like as we approach the equator?</em>"</p>
<p>It gets hotter, you say. True, but how does the data look like in support of this fact?</p>
<p>This site presents plots derived from a Python script that compiles weather data from 500+ cities around the world of varying distance from the equator. Built for the purposes of UC Berkeley Extension's Data Analytics Coding Bootcamp, this project is my work combining my growing knowledge of Python, API handling, data analysis, and visualization.</p>

<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>The goals of this project for the Data Analytics Coding Bootcamp were threefold:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using Matplotlib and Pandas Python libraries, generate a series of clearly labeled scatter plots showcasing the following relationships:
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
            <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Generate successive API calls to OpenWeatherMap <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">Weather API</a> with a randomized list of 500+ unique cities based on latitude and longitide</li>
    <li>Generate and present all the code and analyses using a Jupyter notebook, supplying written descriptions of observable trends based on the data as well as well as exporting a csv of all the data and png images for each scatterplot.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was a challenge to understand how to combine API calls with prior knowledge of Python, with particular emphasis on Pandas and Matplotlib as well as learning how to test code in snippets before running larger processes - in particular, understanding how a custom built Python library, <a href="https://github.com/wingchen/citipy" target="_blank">citipy</a> works in order to effectively make appropriate calls to Weather API.
