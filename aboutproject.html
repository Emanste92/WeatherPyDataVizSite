                <h1>About This Project</h1>
                <p>The goals of this project for the Data Analytics Coding Bootcamp were threefold:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using Matplotlib and Pandas Python libraries, generate a series of clearly labeled scatter plots showcasing the following relationships:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
                            <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
                            <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
                            <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Generate successive API calls to OpenWeatherMap <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">Weather API</a> with a randomized list of 500+ unique cities based on latitude and longitide</li>
                    <li>Generate and present all the code and analyses using a Jupyter notebook, supplying written descriptions of observable trends based on the data as well as well as exporting a csv of all the data and png images for each scatterplot.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project was a challenge to understand how to combine API calls with prior knowledge of Python, with particular emphasis on Pandas and Matplotlib as well as learning how to test code in snippets before running larger processes - in particular, understanding how a custom built Python library, <a href="https://github.com/wingchen/citipy" target="_blank">citipy</a> works in order to effectively make appropriate calls to Weather API. Some highlights during this process include creating a random set of latitude and longitude combinations, creating a random list of unique city names and their countries from the latitude/longitude pairings, making a loop of JSON requests that retrieved the data mentioned above, and then creating specific plots based on the data collected. The data was generated from weather API calls on 10-19-18 for 626 random cities.<p>
                <p> We cannot make too many generalizations as this data is a day snapshot of the current weather of a randomized set of cities; however, it is fair to state that cities closer to the equator (with latitude closer to 0) are warmer than those farther away (with latitudes further away from 0 in both positive and negative directions). It was interesting to see that humidity is high for a good number of the cities in the dataset, regardless of latitude  (possibly explained by another variable not under consideration in this current project). There does not seem to be a strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness (I would also argue that the measurement of cloudiness by OWM and quite possibly the measurement of a unit of 'cloudiness' is somewhat arbitrary, and difficult to discern meaningful insight from such calculations, since there are distinct 'bands' which indicate numerous instances of the same level of cloudiness across cities regardless of latitude.) There seems to be a weak/negligible relationship between latitude and wind speed, with some minor clustering of low windspeeds in the higher latitudes/northern hemisphere. (This variable is probably best measured over time, not in a snapshot instance like the current dataset. Also, I would argue elevation as a third variable is necessary to determine whether there is a relationship between wind speed and latitude, which is not captured with the current dataset.)</p>
                <p>In summary, we can indeed show that the weather does get hotter closer to the equator, even with a day's worth of compiled data of randomized cities around the world. More thorough analyses would include further considerations for important variables such as comparisons over time and city elevation.</p>
